```

Help on flags

```bash
./keepalived-exporter --help
```

Name               | Description
-------------------|------------
web.listen-address | Address to listen on for web interface and telemetry, defaults to `:9165`.
web.telemetry-path | A path under which to expose metrics, defaults to `/metrics`.
ka.json            | Send SIGJSON and decode JSON file instead of parsing text files, defaults to `false`.
ka.pid-path        | A path for Keepalived PID, defaults to `/var/run/keepalived.pid`.
cs                 | Health Check script path to be execute for each VIP.
container-name     | Keepalived container name to export metrics from Keepalived container.
container-tmp-dir  | Keepalived container tmp volume path, defaults to `/tmp`.
endpoint           | shell2http instance url to send signals

**Note:** For `ka.json` option requirement is to have Keepalived compiled with `--enable-json` configure option.

### Keepalived on Docker and Keepalived Exporter on host

Set the `--container-name` to the Keepalived container name and set `--container-tmp-dir` to the Keepalived `/tmp` dir path that is volumed to the host

```bash
./keepalived-exporter --container-name keepalived --container-tmp-dir /tmp
```

### Keepalived and Keepalived Exporter on docker

Volume docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) to Keepalived Exporter cotnainer in the same path and pass the args like as using Keepalived on container

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/cafebazaar/keepalived-exporter
docker run -v keepalived-data:/tmp/ ... $KEEPALIVED_IMAGE
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v keepalived-data:/tmp/keepalived-data:ro -p 9165:9165 ghcr.io/cafebazaar/keepalived-exporter --container-name keepalived --container-tmp-dir "/tmp/keepalived-data"
```

**Note:** Should use one of `endpoint` or `container-name` at a same time.

## Dockerized

### Keepalived on docker
If Keepalived is dockerized and Keepalived Exporter is running on docker host you should pass `--container-name` to Keepalived Exporter.
```bash
./keepalived-exporter --container-name keepalived
```
Also you should volume `/tmp/keepalived.data` and `/tmp/keepalived.stats` (`/tmp/keepalived.json` if using `ka.json`) to `/tmp/` of your host.

### Keepalived and Keepalived Exporter on docker
If both Keepalived and Keepalived Exporter are containerized you should containerized your Keepalived like [here](./keepalived-container/) and pass `--endpoint` to Keepalived Exporter for running shell2http instance on keepalived container.
```bash
docker run keepalived-exporter --endpoint "http://localhost:8080"
```
Also you should volume `/tmp/keepalived.data` and `/tmp/keepalived.stats` (`/tmp/keepalived.json` if using `ka.json`) to `/tmp/` of Keepalived Exporter container.

## Check Script

You can specify a check script like Keepalived script check to check if all the things is okay or not.
The script will run for each VIP and gives an arg `$1` that contains VIP.

**Note:** The script should be executable.

```bash
chmod +x check_script.sh
```

### Sample Check Script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

ping $1 -c 1 -W 1
```
